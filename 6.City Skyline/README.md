# City Skyline with Pure CSS

A dynamic, layered city skyline rendered entirely with HTML and CSS — featuring background and foreground buildings, responsive window styling, and auto theme-switching based on local time.


Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Visual rendering, gradients, flexbox, transitions)
- JavaScript (Time-based theme logic)

Highlights

- **Auto Day/Night Mode**  
  JavaScript checks system time to apply `.theme-day` or `.theme-night` class dynamically.
