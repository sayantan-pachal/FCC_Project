                Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of India’s greatest freedom fighters. Born on January 23, 1897, in
                Cuttack, Odisha,
                he became known for his bold and unyielding commitment to India’s independence. He famously disagreed
                with the Indian National
                Congress's moderate approach and instead advocated for complete and immediate independence. During World
                War II, he formed the
                Indian National Army (INA) to fight against British rule and sought support from Germany and Japan. His
                slogan,
                <strong>"Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom,"</strong> inspired millions.

                Netaji's mysterious death in 1945 remains a subject of debate, but his legacy as a patriot who was
                willing to sacrifice everything
                for his country continues to live on.
